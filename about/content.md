## Overview of the topic
Nullam quis porttitor purus, eu finibus justo.

## Data selection
The intent of this project is to provide a discovery interface to Reconstruction-era Library of Congress content. For that reason, I cast as wide a net as possible, processing all Library of Congress materials from 1865-1877 which are available in fulltext format.

This includes a vast array of material types. Examples include:
* A program for a [service observing Lincoln's funeral](https://loc.gov/item/rbpe.1770390a) in Vermont;
* Reminiscences of a [Black cowboy](https://loc.gov/item/wpalh002179);
* Walt Whitman's notes as he [worked through themes in Leaves of Grass](https://loc.gov/item/mss1863001302);
* A book arguing for [women's rights and equality](https://www.loc.gov/item/09028337/).

However, the vast majority of the documents are newspapers from the [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) project.

## Contact/report
I am the sole person maintaining this project, and there is no funding for my time after January 2022. Therefore, unfortunately, I cannot provide extensive customer service.
