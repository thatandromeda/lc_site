Some welcoming text.

## Why this project?
Nullam quis porttitor purus, eu finibus justo.
* new possibilities for library discovery
  * HAMLET
  * explore/browse
  * when traditional metadata isn't an option

## Why this topic?
Duis cursus semper magna, eu eleifend felis ultrices.
* how we tell the story of Reconstruction is critical to how we understand the story of America
* what I learned was a very particular viewpoint (developed by the daughters of the confederacy???) (thanks Black Twitter)
* make it possible to explore, invite people to grapple with materials and come to their own understandings

## Technology
A goal of this project throughout has been to use the simplest tools available which will get the job done, in order to make the site as easy as possible to maintain over time. This meant relying on Unix tools where possible; using a static site generator for the web site; and (mostly) sticking to widely-deployed, well-tested languages and libraries.

## Team & acknowledgements
A project of this scope cannot be done without many hands at work.

Foremost I would like to thank **my team**. Dr. T.J. Jankun-Kelly, Associate Professor of Computer Science & Engineering within the Bagley College of Engineering, Mississippi State University, reviewed literature on data visualization of large collections and provided research-based guidance on how I could handle this collection. User experience strategist [Frances Botsford](https://switchingprotocols.com/) conducted UX research, wireframed the web site, and implemented the style and much of the interaction design.

I'd also like to thank my **fellow researchers**, [Lauren Tilton](http://laurentilton.com/) and [Lincoln Mullen](https://lincolnmullen.com/), for their perspectives on our related-but-different work. Lincoln in particular gave me helpful guidance from his prior experience processing Library of Congress text files.

At the **Library of Congress**, I had help from the LC Labs team and their orbit: Kate Zwaard, Abigail Potter, Meghan Ferriter, Jaime Mears, Laurie Allen, Eileen Jakeway, Tori Scheppele, Khadijah Camp, and especially my day-to-day liaisons Alice Goldfarb and Olivia Dorsey. Susan Garfinkel and Michelle Krowl helped with reference questions. Nicole Saylor, Christa Maher, Nathan Yarasavage, and Robin Butterhof illuminated the workings of various Library of Congress services. Kelley McNabb and Ellis Brachman advised on communications around our [Wall Street Journal coverage](https://www.wsj.com/articles/library-of-congress-looks-to-ai-to-help-users-sift-through-its-collection-11624552197). Dave Woodward and Krisztina Thatcher provided insights about the development of the [loc.gov API](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/).

The Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud [advisory board](https://labs.loc.gov/work/experiments/cchc/) provided useful feedback on draft work, especially Harriet Green with her comments on highlighting liberatory examples.

[Cecily Walker](https://cecily.info/) helped to assemble literature on algorithmic bias in a library context.

[Ben Schmidt](https://benschmidt.org/) was incredibly generous with his time in helping me understand and troubleshoot deepscatter.

I, [Andromeda Yelton](http://andromedayelton.com/), am responsible for the overall concept, the data pipelines, the machine learning work, some of the front end development, and the web site copy. Any errors and omissions are, of course, entirely my own.

## Next steps
As with any large-scale project, it is all too easy to see the things I didn't have time to do. These include making the visualization searchable; building a scrollytelling-style guided tour; additional user experience testing; and various options for improving data handling.

I can also imagine possibilities which put the technology and insights of this work to very different ends, such as human-in-the-loop but AI-powered OCR correction and improved search capacity for the Library of Congress.
