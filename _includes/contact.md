I am the sole person maintaining this project, and there is no funding for my time after January 2022. Therefore, unfortunately, I cannot provide extensive customer service.

However, pull requests are welcome on GitHub for [this site](https://github.com/thatandromeda/lc_site) or [the data processing pipeline](https://github.com/thatandromeda/lc_etl). You can contact me with brief questions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thatandromeda).
