What if you could see the breadth of content across several collections of historical newspapers at a glance? What if a machine could read all the newspapers for a century and show you articles similar to one you read from any place or year? These were some of the questions that inspired this project which used neural nets to explore the digitized historical newspaper collections dating from 1865 to 1877 in the Library of Congress. 

This experimental project aimed to use, learn about, and help improve computational access to LoC digital content, and to expose more of the rich LoC collections to scholars and the public. Using a neural net and machine learning on OCR content, this exploratory tool serves as a proof of concept for finding potentially similar or related content outside of manual classification.

## Exploring the Collections
As you begin an exploration of the collections, items will scatter across the screen. There are thousands of articles, letters, book chapters, manuscripts, and other text-rich items represented in the display, so some clusters or dots may represent several items when zoomed out. 

Here’s a short video overview of how it works:

The collections included focus on the post-Civil War era of Reconstruction in the United States, and may include challenging material. [Read more about the content](#about-the-collections-and-subject-area)

# About the Collections and Subject Area
The project includes content from a number of collections in the Library of Congress that dates from the United States from between 1865 and 1877 and have been digitized as full text, including Chronicling America, Supreme Court reports and statutes, the Abraham Lincoln Papers, Walt Whitman papers, Elizabeth Cady Stanton papers, among others. The primary focus is on the Reconstruction era. [Learn more](/about/content)
